Fri Jun 05 19:23:30 UTC 2015 : Trek|Away: it might be technically as powerful but it will almost definitely use more power and not support the nvidia features like hairworks and physx
Fri Jun 05 19:24:01 UTC 2015 : TheFrontGuy|work: I thought LTT did a review of the 980ti

Fri Jun 05 19:29:49 UTC 2015 : nmk-tab: Hi again
Fri Jun 05 19:57:28 UTC 2015 : Trek|Away: We are looking for more rewards for the new kickstarter. So far there are 6 physical rewards which we will need to have made up, things like the mugs and shirts have a few different versions. It would be nice to stick to virtual rewards if we can but not a requirement. There are some rules. 1. No rewards based on imaging, remember to start we arent
Fri Jun 05 19:57:29 UTC 2015 : Trek|Away:  flying any hardware. 2. Try to keep the rewards "virtual" That is with no physical presence. 3.nothing we have suggested already

Fri Jun 05 21:02:38 UTC 2015 : N-Spade: this is a good place to get the t-shirts and mugs IMHO
Fri Jun 05 21:02:55 UTC 2015 : N-Spade: I believe we can even set it up to print and send automatically
Fri Jun 05 21:03:50 UTC 2015 : N-Spade: otherwise we'd have to buy 25+ t-shirt and hope they sell
Fri Jun 05 21:04:07 UTC 2015 : N-Spade: this is one of the few- if not the only-print-on-demand places
Fri Jun 05 21:10:55 UTC 2015 : nmk-tab: Trek do you have a link to that doc you where talking about?
Fri Jun 05 21:12:09 UTC 2015 : Trek|Away: which one?

Fri Jun 05 21:17:20 UTC 2015 : nmk-tab: PDF is good
Fri Jun 05 21:17:46 UTC 2015 : nmk-tab: Maybe you could put the PDF in the private Google Drive folder
